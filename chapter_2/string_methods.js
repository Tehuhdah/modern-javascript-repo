// Common String Methods
let email = "jhordantej@gmail.com";

// Returning the last index that a appears in the string.
// let result = email.lastIndexOf("a");

// Returning the string when sliced from the start position, to the end position.
// let result = email.slice(0, 5); // starts from position 0, and then extracts to position 5.

// Returning the substring from the start position, to the length which represents how many characters
// you wish to extract.
// let result = email.substr(4, 10); // Starts at position 4, and then extracts 10 characters.

// Example using negative index
// when using a negative, it starts from the position from the end of the string going backwards.

// Starts at -5 position which is l, then continues to the end of the string.
// console.log(email.slice(-5)); // Outputs: "l.com"
// Starts at -5 position which is l, then continues until it extracts 4 characters.
// console.log(email.substr(-5, 4)); // Outputs: "l.co"

// Replaces the character specified in the first argument, with the character in the second argument.
// let result = email.replace("a", "$");

console.log(result);
